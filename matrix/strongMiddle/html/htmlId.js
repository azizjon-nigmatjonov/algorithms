// In HTML, id attribute is used to apply a unique id to an HTML element.
// id should be unique, cause you get id with getElementById in JavaScript file, this gets only one element,
// if you give your id to another element, the second one would be ignored by JavaScript.

// to give same style or function to several elements you can use class attribute
