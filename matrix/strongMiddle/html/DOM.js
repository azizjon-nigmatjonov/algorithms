// The HTML DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents.
// It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
// The HTML DOM model is created as a tree of objects:

// The HTML document itself is an object.
// The document contains all the HTML elements (such as <body>, <p>, <div>, etc.), each of which is an object.
// Each HTML element contains other HTML elements as well as text, and each of these is an object.
// Attributes of HTML elements are also objects.

// The HTML DOM model allows you to access and manipulate the content and structure of an HTML document using programming languages
// such as JavaScript. You can use the HTML DOM to:

// 1. Change the content of an HTML element
// 2. Change the style (CSS) of an HTML element
// 3. Add or remove HTML elements and attributes
// 4. Create new HTML elements and attributes
// 5. Respond to events such as a user clicking on an element or a page finishing loading.
