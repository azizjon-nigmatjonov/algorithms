// Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) can be used to style and animate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files in a web page. Here are some ways to work with SVG using CSS:

// 1. Styling SVG elements: CSS can be used to style SVG elements, including setting fill and stroke colors, adjusting opacity, and adding borders and shadows. This can be done using class, ID, or attribute selectors in CSS.

// 2. Animating SVG elements: CSS can also be used to animate SVG elements using keyframes and transitions. This can be used to create animations like fading in or out, moving an element across the screen, or scaling an element up or down.

// 3. Using CSS filters: CSS filters can be applied to SVG elements to add effects like blurring, sharpening, or adjusting color. This can be useful for creating interesting visual effects on SVG graphics.

// 4. Responsive design with SVG: Since SVG graphics are scalable vector images, they can be easily resized without losing quality. This makes them ideal for use in responsive web design, where the graphics can be resized to fit different screen sizes and resolutions.

// 5. Combining CSS and SVG with JavaScript: CSS and SVG can be combined with JavaScript to create more complex and dynamic interactions. For example, JavaScript can be used to control the animation or behavior of SVG elements based on user input or other events.

// Overall, CSS provides a powerful set of tools for working with SVG files in web design. By using CSS to style and animate SVG graphics, designers and developers can create dynamic and engaging web experiences.
