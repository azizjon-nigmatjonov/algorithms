// CSS alignment is the process of positioning and aligning elements within a webpage. There are several ways to align elements using CSS, including:

// 1. Text alignment: You can align text to the left, center, or right of a container using the text-align property.
// 2. Vertical alignment: You can align elements vertically within a container using the `vertical-align` property. 
// This property works differently for different types of elements, such as inline, inline-block, and table-cell elements.
// 3. Horizontal alignment: You can align elements horizontally using the `margin` property. You can set the margin value to auto, 
// which centers the element horizontally within its container.
// 4. Flexbox alignment: Flexbox is a layout model that allows you to align elements both horizontally and vertically. 
// You can use the justify-content and align-items properties to align elements within a flex container.
// 5. Grid alignment: CSS Grid is another layout model that allows you to align elements within a grid. 
// You can use the justify-items and align-items properties to align elements within a grid container.
