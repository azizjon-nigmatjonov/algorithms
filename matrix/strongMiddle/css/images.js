// CSS allows you to manipulate images on a webpage in various ways, such as resizing, cropping, and adding effects. Here are some examples of
// how to work with images in CSS:

// 1. Adding an image: You can add an image to a webpage using the background-image property. Here's an example:
// .image {
//     background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
//   }
// This will add an image to an element with the class "image".

// 2. Resizing an image: You can resize an image using the width and height properties. Here's an example:
// .image {
//     width: 200px;
//     height: 200px;
//   }
// This will resize an image to be 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.

// 3. Cropping an image: You can crop an image using the background-position property. Here's an example:
// .image {
//     background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
//     background-position: center;
//     background-size: cover;
//   }
// This will crop an image to fit the element it's in, centered, and cover the entire space.

// 4. Adding effects to an image: You can add effects to an image using the filter property. Here's an example:
// .image {
//     filter: grayscale(100%);
//   }
// This will make an image appear in grayscale.

// These are just a few examples of how to manipulate images using CSS. There are many other ways to modify images, including
// adjusting brightness and contrast, adding blur, and using CSS animations. With CSS, you can create visually engaging and dynamic webpages
//  that showcase your images in unique and creative ways.
